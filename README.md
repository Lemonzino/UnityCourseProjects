# Unity Projects

Seven projects made during the Unity course


**DevCraft**: A minecraft clone. Made for mobile platforms.

**HaunterZombieRush**: A Flappy bird clone.

**Legend of Devslopes**: A third person hack-n-slash action game diablo-like. 

**Lighting**: A scene with lights. Really, nothing more. The aim was to learn the lighting tools.

**MOBA**: A MOBA like game. There is no real game design or complex mechanics because the aim of this project was to introduce the multiplayer concepts.

**Roll-A-Zombie**: A game where you earn points by rolling zombie heads on buttons without letting them fall off the plane.

**TowerDefense**: A simple tower defense game.
